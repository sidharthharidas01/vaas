Fabricon app

Aim of Fabricon app is to bridge the gap between people who want fabrication services and such service providers (Eg. 3D printing, 
Laser cutting etc.) and individuals who have the required fab-tools.

Fabricon is an online platform to provide fabrication services to the needy.
People who want to fabricate anything can find other users/fab-service providers who have required tools for the same and contact them. 
Fabricon provides feature to chat, discuss designs and negotiate price. The clients (one who wants things to be fabricated) can search
for required tools, price ranges and ratings and get relevant suggestions. Then they can contact the 'Pros', who can fabricate the product
and ship it to the client. 
Both existing service providers and users who have tools can register as Pros.
